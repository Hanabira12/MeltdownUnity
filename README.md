# Meltdown


So far, we have the maze part of the map set up as well as player movement/jumping abilities functional. The sprite
animation for idle/walking is in place--we don't have a sprite animation for jumping, but we probably won't add one
due to time limitations. We also have some background music to go with the game. Some restructuring may need to be 
done if the map is too large to be completed in the time limit we intend to impose, but this will come later once 
we get the timer working. We hope to be able to add puzzle features in at least one or two points which the player 
must solve to progress, but we will complete the map before adding any new features.
